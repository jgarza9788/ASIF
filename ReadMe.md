## requirments
just run the requirments file
```
pip install -r requirments.exe
```

## run 
```
python main.py
```

## why?
1. i liked the windows search folders, but i switched to one commander. And then i missed this functionality.
2. i want to see if this will put me on the dearpygui showcase.

> note
> i found that i could just use everything.exe with a command and just just a list of the files.
